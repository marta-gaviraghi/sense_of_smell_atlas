# **Sense of Smell (SoS) atlas** 

### **1. Introduction** 
The **Sense of Smell (SoS) atlas** is a neuroimaging atlas specifically designed for studying the olfactory network. It provides a standardized reference for analyzing the brain regions and tracts involved in the sense of smell.
This atlas is divided into two separate NIfTI (.nii.gz) files in MNI-125 space:
- **Grey matter (GM) regions of interest (ROIs)**
- **White matter (WM) tracts**

The SoS Atlas facilitates the localization and study of structural differences in the olfactory network and can be used in various neuroimaging studies.

### **2. Atlas Contents**  
The repository contains the following key files:  

**SoS_atlas/**  
```
├── GM-ROI_SoS_atlas.nii.gz   # Grey matter regions of interest (ROIs)
├── GM-ROI_SoS_atlas_list.txt #Labels for GM-ROI SoS atlas
├── WM-tract_SoS_atlas.nii.gz  # White matter tracts
├── WM-Tract_SoS_atlas_list.txt #Labels for WM-Tract SoS atlas
├── README.md             # This documentation


```
### **3. Installation & Download**  
To use the SoS atlas, you can clone this repository using Git:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marta-gaviraghi/sense_of_smell_atlas.git

```

Alternatively, download the individual NIfTI files from the repository.
