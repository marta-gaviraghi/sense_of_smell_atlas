# **Sense of Smell (SoS) atlas** 

### **1. Introduction** 
The **Sense of Smell (SoS) atlas** is a neuroimaging atlas specifically designed for studying the olfactory network. It provides a standardized reference for analyzing the brain regions and tracts involved in the sense of smell.
This atlas is divided into two separate NIfTI (.nii.gz) files in MNI-125 space:
- **Grey matter (GM) regions of interest (ROIs)**
- **White matter (WM) tracts**
The SoS Atlas facilitates the localization and study of structural differences in the olfactory network and can be used in various neuroimaging studies.

### **2. Atlas Contents**  
The repository contains the following key files:  

📁 **SoS_atlas/**  
```
├── GM-ROI_SoS_atlas.nii.gz   # Grey matter regions of interest (ROIs)
├── WM-tract_SoS_atlas.nii.gz  # White matter tracts
├── README.md             # This documentation
```
### **3. Installation & Download**  
To use the SoS atlas, you can either download the files manually or clone this repository using Git:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sense_of_smell_atlas.git
```

Alternatively, download the individual NIfTI files from the repository.
